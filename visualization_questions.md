1. **What is the distribution of house prices within different cities?**
   - **Plot Type:** Box Plot
   - **Description:** This plot will help identify the range and distribution of house prices across different cities. Each box in the plot represents a city, showing the median price, quartiles, and outliers. This analysis can reveal cities with higher or lower median prices and variability in housing costs, useful for understanding regional market dynamics.

2. **How do the sizes of houses (in square feet) correlate with their prices?**
   - **Plot Type:** Scatter Plot
   - **Description:** A scatter plot can be used to visualize the relationship between house sizes and their prices. Each point on the plot represents a house, with its position determined by its size and price. This analysis helps to understand if larger houses tend to have higher prices and how strong the correlation between these two variables is.

3. **What is the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms per house in each state?**
   - **Plot Type:** Bar Plot
   - **Description:** This plot will show two bars for each state, one representing the average number of bedrooms and the other the average number of bathrooms in houses within that state. This can provide insights into regional housing trends and preferences, as well as help identify states with generally larger or smaller homes.

4. **How has the average house price changed over time based on the previously sold date?**
   - **Plot Type:** Line Plot
   - **Description:** A line plot can be used to visualize changes in the average house price over time, with the x-axis representing time (grouped by months or years based on the prev_sold_date) and the y-axis representing the average price. This plot can help identify trends in the real estate market, such as price increases or decreases over certain periods.

5. **What is the relationship between the lot size (in acres) and the living space (in square feet)?**
   - **Plot Type:** Hexbin Plot or 2D Histogram
   - **Description:** This plot is useful for datasets with a large number of entries, like this real estate dataset. It will show the density of points at the intersection of lot size and living space, helping to identify common combinations of lot sizes and house sizes. This analysis can reveal if there's a typical ratio between land and living space across the dataset.
