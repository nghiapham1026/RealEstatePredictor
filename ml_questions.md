1. **Model to Predict House Prices in Different Cities**
   - **Objective:** Develop a regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their attributes and city.
   - **Features:** House size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, city, and possibly other features like age of the house or proximity to amenities.
   - **Output:** Estimated price of a house.
   - **Usefulness:** This model would directly support the analysis in your first question about the distribution of house prices across different cities by providing predicted values that can be compared against actual market data to evaluate market conditions and predict future trends.

2. **Model to Estimate Relationship Between House Size and Price**
   - **Objective:** Build a regression model that predicts house prices based on the size of the house (square feet).
   - **Features:** House size, possibly refined by adding other correlating features such as location or lot size.
   - **Output:** Price of the house.
   - **Usefulness:** This model correlates directly with your second question and can be used to understand and quantify the strength of the relationship between house size and price, which can help in setting pricing guidelines or assessing market value.

3. **Model to Classify House Characteristics by State**
   - **Objective:** Develop a classification or clustering model to predict or group houses based on common characteristics within a state.
   - **Features:** Number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, house size, and other relevant features that might distinguish houses in different states.
   - **Output:** Classification or clustering of houses by state, based on average characteristics.
   - **Usefulness:** This model aligns with your third visualization question by providing a method to automatically categorize houses into typical state profiles, helping in understanding regional preferences and designing targeted real estate strategies.
